==Abstract==

This BIPs describes a one-time increase in the maximum non-witness block size from 1MB to 2MB, triggered by the activation of segwit as of BIP91, but delayed approximately 3 months after segwit activation.

To prevent DoS attacks, transaction serialized size is limited to 1,000,000 bytes, excluding witness data.

This BIP is dual-licensed under the Open Publication License and BSD 2-clause license.

==Motivation==

# Enabling Segwit
# Reducing temporarily the fee pressure until other scaling techniques such as the Lighntning Network, sidechains, drivechains and extension blocks prove to be useful or not for Bitcoin scaling.
# Maximum transaction size is kept, to maximize compatibility with current software and prevent algorithmic and data size DoS's.

==Rationale==

The "transaction pattern" is defined as the average number and size of transaction inputs and outputs in a block.
Assuming the current transaction pattern is replicated in a 2 MB plain-sized block that is 100% filled with transactions, then the witness-serialized block would occupy 3.6 MB [1]. This is considered safe by many users, companies, miners and academics [2]. 

==Specification==

# The plain block size is defined as the serialized block size without witness programs.
# Deploy a modified BIP91 to activate Segwit. The only modification is that the signal "segsignal" is replaced by "segwit2x".
# If segwit2x (BIP91 signal) activates at block N, then block N+12960 activates a new plain block size limit of 2 MB (2,000,000 bytes). In this case, at block N+12960 a hard-fork occurs.
# The block that activates the hard-fork must have a plain block size greater than 1 MB.
# Any transaction with a non-witness serialized size exceeding 1,000,000 is invalid.


==Backward compatibility==

Older clients are not compatible with this change.  The first block exceeding 1,000,000 bytes will partition older clients off the new network.

==Discussion==

In the short term, an increase is needed to continue to facilitate
network growth, and buy time for more comprehensive solutions to be
developed and tested, such as the Lightning Network, sidechains, drivechains and extension blocks.
This reduces the fee pressure on users and companies creating on-chain transactions, matching market expectations and preventing further market disruption.
